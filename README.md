# Lab1 Starter Code
This repository contains the code template for Lab 6 Data Visualization developed for the course TIL6022 Python Programming at TU Delft. 

## Instructions for Teachers

Use this as a template to create the lab 6 assignment in GitHub Classroom to enable automatic grading of code submissions. 

The repository contains the Jupyter Notebook lab6_2025.ipynb, which students will work on. The repo needs to contain a test file for this Jupyter Notebook for the autograding. 
The test file included here is lab6_test.py. 

## Instructions for Students

After receiving the assignment, modify the code in the Jupyter Notebook and commit the changes you made. Each commit counts as one submission to the GitHub Classroom. 

> [!WARNING]
> Do not change the test file and the file name of the Jupyter Notebook.
